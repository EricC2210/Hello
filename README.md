# Hello
My very first repository

Hi guys! 

Happy to be here. This is the first time I take a ride on GitHub. Even if I can code a little bit (my job is actually related to IT), I'm not a sharp and very skilled developer indeed. Let say I'm just a curious who wants to open his mind to exciting new technologies and learn a bit more how to code by the way.
